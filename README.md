Citi Bike Program Analysis Assignment Overview

In this assignment, you will analyze data from the Citi Bike program, the largest bike-sharing system in the United States, operating in New York City since 2013. The Citi Bike program collects detailed trip data every month, which is made publicly available for analysis. Your task is to aggregate and analyze this data to identify key trends and phenomena, answering critical questions from city officials and stakeholders about the program's usage patterns, growth, and areas for improvement.

Your main goal is to use this data to uncover unexpected trends and insights related to bike usage, such as changes in ridership, shifts in user demographics, peak usage times, and the popularity of bike stations. You will be expected to design 4-10 visualizations in Tableau that showcase your findings and create dashboards for each identified phenomenon. Additionally, you will present a dynamic map of bike station usage, including markers indicating station popularity and changes over time. Your final deliverable will be a Tableau story that consolidates your visualizations, maps, and dashboards into a clear, logical, and visually appealing presentation, accompanied by an analysis that explains the findings in an accessible manner for a non-technical audience.

This assignment will challenge your ability to clean and analyze complex data, as well as present your results in a way that is both informative and visually compelling. Your work will be evaluated on the rigor of your analysis, the clarity and readability of your visualizations, and the overall presentation of your findings.
